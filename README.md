# Predicting University Admissions Using Linear Regression Analysis

---

## 📌 Abstract

This study explores the use of **linear regression analysis** to predict **university admission probability** based on key academic and examination-related factors such as **GRE Score**, **TOEFL Score**, **CGPA**, and other relevant attributes.

The research focuses on providing insights through careful **data preparation**, **modeling**, and **analysis** to better understand the factors that influence admission outcomes. The dataset used in this study was thoroughly prepared to ensure **data integrity and consistency**.

By applying linear regression techniques, the study evaluates the **predictive strength** of each factor and discusses their implications in admission decision-making. In addition, different approaches to data handling and modeling are explored, leading to recommendations for optimizing **data preparation and analysis processes** to improve the **accuracy and reliability** of admission predictions.
