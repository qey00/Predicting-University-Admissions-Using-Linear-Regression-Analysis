"Predicting University Admissions Using Linear Regression Analysis"
Abstract
This study explores the usage of linear regression analysis to predict university admissions based on the key factors like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, CGPA, and other relevant data. The study aims to provide insights through rigorous data preparation, modeling, and analysis that aims to provide insights into the factors that influence the University Admission probability. The dataset used in this study was carefully prepared to ensure data integrity. By employing linear regression, the study evaluates the predictive power of these factors and discusses their implications for admission decisions. Through an exploration of different techniques and approaches, the paper offers recommendations for optimizing data preparations and analysis processes that aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of admission predictions.
